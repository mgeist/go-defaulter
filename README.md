# go-defaulter

This was written as an experiment. It's goal was to be a drop-in replacement for https://github.com/BetterWorks/defaulter.

I was successful in this goal. I wanted to compare performance between the Node version and this one, written in Go. If I remember correctly, the performance between the two was similar.
One day I'll revisit it to see what a few more years of experience under my belt have taught me.
